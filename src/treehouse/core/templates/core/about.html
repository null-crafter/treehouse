<p class="text">Hi, although I've talked about myself on the homepage, we need an about page, so about page:</p>
<p class="text">I went to college for CompSci, but learned about sociology instead. LMAO, imagine being me. I will not reincarnate Dante's Inferno for this. Instead, I'm thinking about starting a substack, having seen what a <a href="https://www.culturalfuturist.net/" class="link">Cultural-Fu</a> could do with it. However, I will bear in mind that I've brought back my website multiple times, so I will keep it alive, even after I decide to make a substack. Hmm, I think I can serve RSS feeds and arbitrary files with a separate website.</p>
<p class="text">In case you are curious, this website is not using <a href="https://jamstack.org/" class="link">Jamstack</a> like a regular Hugo blog. I want it to be a Django site so I can experiment interesting things with it.</p>
<p class="text">Anyhoo, thanks for visiting my treehouse website.</p>
